# Introduction
Let me present to you.....
The one and only....
"Botcat.click!"

This little project is written in shell, and will work on most linux systems. This project was especially made for Raspberry Pi OS (formerly Raspbian), but as stated before, it should work for most linux distros (no guarantee it will).

soooooooo, with that little introduction, here is the installation process!

# Installation :D

Step 1:
  clone the git repository
  (git clone https://github.com/SpamixOfficial/Botcat.git)

Step 2:
  make em all executable (if needed)!
  (chmod +x filename)

Step 3:
  You're done!
  
# How to use
To start the script, just start botcat.sh! Starting botcat.sh will start the 2 other scripts. It kind of works like a executer. 

# NOTE 
Right now, there is no way to stop the script (im sorry!). I will try to add a way in the future, but right now I am focusing on other projects!

# Extra info :D

This project is completely open source, so tweak it all you want! If something doesnt work, go to stack overflow and start searching! If you cant figure out how to fix it, just post a question, and ill help asap!

Have fun and play around with it! 
:D
